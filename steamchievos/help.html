			<h1>How do I get the correct Steam id?</h1>
			<p>Go to <a href = "https://steamid.io/">steamid.io</a> and look up your username or go to <a href = "http://steamidfinder.com/">steamidfinder.com</a> and type in your steam url. The one youre looking for is the 64 steam id.</p>
			<h1>What is this website used for?</h1>
			<p>As an achievement hunter in my free time I've always wanted a website that was able to tell me achievements that are hard to get and achievements that are easy to get for games I own. So I created this website. It is run solely by me for fun.</p>
			<h1>I think there's a glitch.</h1>
			<p>This is very likely. Steam api can be very glitchy so please contact me if you believe there is. If there is a game specific glitch and enough people let me know I will just remove the game from the list. I will try to remove any other glitches to the best of my ability.</p>
			Some known glitches:
			<ul>
			<li>The website is very slow. I know this. I'm trying my best to get it to run faster but at the moment there are so many things to find that it's hard to find exactly what you want fast using steam api.</li>
			<li>If the game looks something like "ValveTestApp" and then a number, use the website <a href="https://steamdb.info/apps/">steamdb.info/apps</a> and look up the number. </li>
			<li>If the achievement description is empty this means the achievement is secret.</li>
			<li>If the name of the game is empty this usually means you havent played the game yet.</li>
			</ul>
